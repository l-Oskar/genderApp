# 🍼 GenderApp

(Only for Smatphones📲)
GenderApp is a simple web application that collects and displays voting results for a gender reveal party. Guests can choose their prediction (Boy/Girl) and confirm their vote. After all votes are submitted, the results are displayed with a slight delay to add some suspense and excitement to the event.

## 🚀 Features

- **Vote for Gender**: Guests can choose between "Boy" or "Girl" and confirm their vote.
- **Delayed Results**: After all participants have voted, the result is displayed with a delay to build suspense.
- **Real-time updates**: The app uses React and Redux Toolkit to manage state and ensure smooth user interaction.
